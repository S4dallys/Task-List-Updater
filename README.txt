Hello! 

The exe file in the folder is the main script. Executing it for the first time might leave you a bit confused. Well, for this script, you will need a text file for the script to append to. Please create one now. 

Wherever the text file is, and make sure it's a .txt file, right click it and click 'properties'. Copy the 'location' without double or single quotes.

Open up the app and type '!pa [location] confirm' without the single quotes. After the location type a foward slash then the text file's name. 
Ex. C:users/jim/Desktop/ --> C:/users/jim/Desktop/TASKS.txt
The path file will have an example path of someone's (it's mine) desktop.

The script needs all three .txt files in the folder: 'dev', 'path' and 'pro'.

Thanks for downloading! Make sure to check out all the commands by typing them out without anything after. Ex. !qa
